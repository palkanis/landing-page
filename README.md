# landing-page
In this project, I was able to use all the knowledge acquired from the CSS and FlexBox modules of The Odin Project.

Building popular web page layouts from scratch was a great experience as I had to challenge myself to think about unique ways to replicate a web page design, something I hadn't done before.

I used multiple flexbox and CSS properties to get the desired result, and working on this project has solidified my basics. Looking forward to what comes next!
